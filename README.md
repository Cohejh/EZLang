This repository contains two things:
- The spec for **EZLang**.
- **OpenEZ** - Our implementation of that spec, as a compiler.

You can find each in their own folder. More information about both below.

# EZLang
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/license-mit.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/it-works-why.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/powered-by-flux-capacitor.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

EZLang is an easy-to-learn programming language designed by us. The syntax resembles English, and is easy to understand. However, despite the simple syntax, EZLang is very powerful, and will eventually be able to do any task, as we add new features with every release.

If you wish to make your own open-source (or closed-source) implementation of EZLang, the language spec is available <a href="https://github.com/Cohejh/EZLang/tree/main/EZLang">here</a>.

If you have made your own implementation, then feel free to contact us, so that we can include it on this page.

# OpenEZ
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/works-on-my-machine.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/open-source.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/license-mit.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

OpenEZ is our own open-source implementation of EZLang. It is written in Python, and compiles your EZ code into Python. As we decide the language specifications, it will always be the most up to date. It offers configurable compiling options, providing different compilation targets. It is MIT Licenced, so that you can modify it to your heart's content.
