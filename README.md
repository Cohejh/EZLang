# EZLang
'''
A simple programming language with natural syntax.
Need to make it accessible
problem is there are many available and popular coding languages in use right now that are just that...
also what language should we use as base? as in english word? new language? code? pig latin?

This is more of a programming exercise than making an actual useful language. (For now)
In regards to syntax, i have written a demo script `test.ez` which is the script that we need to write a compiler for.
